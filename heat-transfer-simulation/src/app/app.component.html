    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      This simulation calculates the final temperature of water in a storage tank using the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Solar Panel:</strong> Collects energy based on efficiency, area, and solar radiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pump:</strong> Transfers collected energy with a given efficiency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Storage Tank:</strong> Calculates the final temperature based on the transferred energy, capacity of the tank, and initial water temperature.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ensure that all input values are greater than zero and properly entered to get accurate results.
